# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* After cloning to your computer, you need to see if the Ruby version (version 3.1.2p20) and Rails version (version 7.1.3.2) match.
If not, you need to update accordingly.
If appropriate, go to the terminal and enter the command line "rails db:migrate" to create the migration, then enter the command "rails s" to run the server.


* Thanks <3
